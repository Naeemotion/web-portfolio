      <h3>Professional Web developer</h3>
      <p>I am a passionate web developer with 12 years of experience building virtual platforms for organizations at a professional level. My experience with development software is primarily JavaScript and Ajax, but I am also comfortable using Perl, C++, PHP, and Java, among others. I am creative and detail-oriented in designing platforms that are functional and user-friendly. I have a strong understanding of the use of SEO and social media in building brand awareness and gaining visibility in search engine rankings. I also value the use of mobile programming to design a well-rounded platform that caters to the unique needs of each customer I serve.</p>

      <h2>Big Dream</h2>
      <h3>Become World's No.1 Developer</h3>
      <p>As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.
        It all started when my grandparents purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first computer I had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used it for games, which my grandma would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the functionality of which, unfortunately, was very limited. The relatively new computer industry's technology could not produce enough colors to portray very realistic pictures. Despite this fact, I spent many contented hours creating images on my grandparent's computer.A few years later, my family moved. As we were no longer close enough to use my grandparent's computer, we purchased a new one for ourselves. I again used the computer for games and did some text editing, but started to utilize the paint program even more than I had before. The up-to-date colors available meant that I could create fairly high-quality pictures. However, my limited paint program again handicapped my skills, its inadequate tools requiring me to draw every pixel manually, which proved very time consuming.

        <p>A Full Stack Developer is a relatively new role which brings together the skills and roles for what were traditionally known as web designer and web developer. Web designer worked on the design of the site, and the web developer worked on the code. As the web has grown more and more complex, and customers are seeking more complex solutions for their on-line presence, the two roles have become more specialised and technical. Further in some cases, the two roles and skills have become inter-linked, resulting in the position of Full Stack Developer.</p>
